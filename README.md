Fibonacci Iterative and Recursive
There are few things that can be done in this repository, they are comparing Fibonacci iterative and recursive results, the time, and the CPU usage of both Fibonacci.

Run
Before running the algorithm, make sure to do this first:

make clear
After that, run this code. This code will create mylib.o automatically and create main.out

make all
Lastly, running this code will ask you the numbers for the Fibonacci and instantly give you the results of both Fibonacci.

./main.out
Results:

Input a number:10
Fibonacci Iterative of 10 = 55
Fibonacci Recursive of 10 = 55
Time complexity Benchmark
Running these codes will describe the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.
Disclaimer: If you haven't run the code above before, the benchmark won't work. Thus, if you want to do the benchmark without running the code above. You need to run this first:

make mylib.o

To see the time complexity of Fibonacci Iterative, you need to do this:

make timei
./timei.out
Then the program asks you to put the number what you want.

Input a number: 10
Lastly, the program will display the results.

Time taken Fibonacci Iterative of 10 :0.000001 seconds

To see the time complexity of Fibonacci Recursive, you need to do this:

make timer
./timer.out
Then the program asks you to put the number what you want.

Input a number: 10
Lastly, the program will display the results.

Time taken Fibonacci Recursive of 10 :0.000002 seconds
Space Complexity Benchmark
This will show the total space taken by the algorithm with respect to the input size. \

Disclaimer: If you haven't run the code above before, the benchmark won't work. Thus, if you want to do the benchmark without running the code above. You need to run this first:

make mylib.o

To check the space complexity of Fibonacci Iterative, run this code below:

make spacei
./spacei.out
The program will display this.

press Ctrl + C to interrupt the process
parameter: 100000
Lastly, To check the CPU Usage, go to task manager and find VmmemWSL. 



To check the space complexity of the Fibonacci Iterative, run this code below:

make spacer
./spacer.out
The program will display this.

press Ctrl + C to interrupt the process
parameter: 100000
Lastly, To check the CPU Usage, go to task manager and find VmmemWSL.
